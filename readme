	
This is a utility Program which will search a directory recursively in Java on Unix/Solaris Machine for XML Files


Requirements :
  Ex : http://www.corp.att.com/attconnectsupport (URLS are different)
       Starting from http
       Delimiter is Enter
       
		Java program to search through the xml files for URLs and insert into a 
	  	delimited text file that is saved back to the Docbase.
	    We need to search through directories in Unix Path is /data/web/absweb/ABS_EM/persistent	
	    Inside there are around 900 xml files..
		We need search inside these xml files and find all urls's in that
		and insert those to text file saved back to docbase that text file with result..
		complete url to text file..Yes..

Steps :

	1) Search for a directory recursively in Unix using Java
	2) Grab all the XML files and store them in Memory
	3) Extract all URLs from these XML files using Search API etc  
	4) write them to the text file
	4) Save the Text file in the same document base
 

Software Requirements :
   1) Please make sure you have latest Java6 onwards installed in your machine. Java 8 is the best
   
 How to run the Program :  
   1) Open Command Line and Type java -version and make Java 7 or Java8 is installed.
   2) Go to the directory where ExtractURLs.jar is located from Command Line
   3) Place config.properties in the same folder. This Step is very important.The Program will not run if this Step is not followed
   			filePath        = /data/web/absweb/ABS_EM/persistent
		  outputFilePath    = /data/web/absweb/ABS_EM/persistent
		  outputFileName    = urls
		  fileExt           = .txt
   3) Type ./ExtractURLs.jar to run the Program
    
   
    


/** Utility to search XML Files and extract URL
 * 
 * Things done :
 * 		  1) Read the XML Files one by one and extract the URLs from the files  approx 900 XML Files : Done
		  2) Use Parser to extract the URLs : Done
		  3) store the URLs in a List : Done
		  4) Print the URLs in a textfile : Done. 
		  5) Store the URLs in a delimited text file : Done 
		  6) Outputfile is saved as currentdateurls.txt.ex 2016-09-29urls.txt 
		  7) Please use config.properties to update the following 
		  			filePath        = /data/web/absweb/ABS_EM/persistent
					outputFilePath  = /data/web/absweb/ABS_EM/persistent
					outputFileName  = urls
					fileExt         = .txt
		  
		  			
 * 
 * TODO : 
 * 		  1) Fix Delimitier for files which have multiple URLS.: DONE
 * 		  2) TEST : test the no of URLs in a file : WIP
 * 		  3) Print all the URLs in a textfile. : DONE
          4) Cater for Duplicate URLS? : TODO?
